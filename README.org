Swenglish is an app that helps English speakers learn Swedish

The game has 3 modes: Pictures, Definitions, and Wordplay.
Every mode has multiple categories to choose from. It's a great way to learn the names of animals, colours, and even family relations!

Submitted as final project for the Dialogue Systems course at GÃ¶teborgs Universitet.

To run:
#+begin_src sh
  npm install
  npm start
#+end_src
